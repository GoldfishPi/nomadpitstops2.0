Featuring calming rice patties, tranquil villages, and the tallest mountain in all of south east Asia, Sa Pa has become a staple for backpackers visiting Vietnam. However, how well does this hilly terrain suite the working traveler?

## Tourism Alert!
Sa Pa the town is the densest tourist attraction I have ever visited. Seriously, half of the buildings in the city are hotels and it's difficult to walk down the street without being bombarded with people trying to sell you souvenirs. For some this might be fun and exciting but for me it left a bad taste in my mouth, which was unfortunate because up until this point I loved the cities in Vietnam.

I cannot stress this enough that if you are traveling to Sa Pa and you don't like tourist areas, pay the four dolors to go to the villages rather then staying in the city. The village itself is rather westernized and still has backpackers at every turn but it isn't nearly as dense and there are fewer hotels.

## Atmosphere
There is something magical about being completely engrossed in the work on your laptop, communicating with co-workers and solving problems, then looking up and saying, "Oh hi cow".

That is the beauty of working in the villages near Sa Pa, you are working amongst a serene landscape with nothing but the sounds of the occasional passing motorcycle to disturb the piece. For many this is the dram life, grab a coconut from the local market, get cozy in a hammock and work until your heart's content. 

## The Backpacker "Problem"
Sa Pa is ultimately a backpacker destination so don't expect to be "alone" when you travel there. There is two sides to this coin. On one hand western style cafes and restaurants are prevalent, which makes for fantastic work spaces. On the other hand you may have to put up with some drunk twenty somethings. Your millage will very, however, I decided to cut this part of my trip short because of it.

## Should I Go?
I wouldn't recommend working here long term. On one hand it's beautiful, peacefull, and an atmosphere like nothing else. However, on the other hand it's incredibly touristy and hard to find the raw genuine experiences I personally crave. For these reasons I would use Sa Pa as a get away for a week from your more permanent situation in a better location.
