Vietnam is one of the most beautiful countries I've ever visited. With the combination of a rich culture, beautiful vistas and some of the most friendly people on the entire planet you would be doing yourself a disservice to not visit this mysterious country. 

## Internet
Internet in Vietnam is astonishingly good, I've been in tiny huts in the nowhere yet I was still able to find somewhere which provided a solid 20mb/s connection over WiFi. Even if the WiFi was terrible, however, I was able to purchase a 128 GB data plan for around $25 with an additional $7 for the sim. 

## Electricity
Electricity supply in Vietnam is 220 Volts at 50Hz and there plug types support most A, C and F type pins. Which in short means that if you have two vertical pins or two round pins you are pretty much set to go. However, Vietnamese plugs don't have a ground line which means if your plug has a third pin you're gonna need an adapter. I found an adapter for my laptop for around 30.000 vnd ($1.30) but I would not push you're luck if you have a "rare" adapter type it took me a bit of looking to find one.

## Workspaces

The workspaces in Vietnam is one of the best reasons to go there. In short the Vietnamese people adore all things coffee and cafes which means you can plop yourself down in any random nook or cranny order yourself some of the best coffee in the entire world and work until your heart's content. The downside is that most cafes in major cities only have little stools you can squat at but with a little hunting you can find somewhere suitable fairly easily.

Co-working spaces are also fairly 
ubiquitous but they will usually run you $6 a day and don't expect any frills...or coffee which is a major bummer if you are like me and that is one of the main requirements for life sustainability. 

## Hospitality

### Hostels

If you're on a short term trip and you're ready to deal with slightly noisy slightly smelly twenty somethings then hostels are the way to go. I've found them from $4 - $10 on the low end everywhere I went that almost always included breakfast too. 

### Hotels
If you are traveling solo I really would not bother with hotels. They tend to run you $6 - $30 on the low end. The service was never anything spectacular and the locations usually left something to be desired, either to far away from the action or too close to tourist areas.

### Apartments and Airbnb
This is an absolutely  amazing option for if you are ready to get out of the tourist areas and see some real culture. If you're in a city don't expect western living sizes or standards. I've stayed at airbnbs as low as $10 a night in Vietnam but you can get something much nicer in the $20-$15 range.

## Food

The food in Vietnam is frankly amazing, and for an amazing price too. You can find some of the classics such as Pho (A salty noodle soup including vegitables and herbs) and Banh Mi (A baguette stuffed with crunchy vegitables and beef) or some of the lesser known delicacies such as Bun Ca (A fish and dill soup). Seriously the food here is insane and late nights standing on the side of the road eating out of a banana leaf is an amazing experience. A meal on the streets can cost you as little as $ 0.50.
