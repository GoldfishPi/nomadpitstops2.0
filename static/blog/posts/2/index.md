For many travels the Ha Giang Loop is the final frontier. Bordering Vietnam and china if you choose to conquer this extreme motorbike loop you will be treated to some of the most majestic vistas in the whole of Vietnam.

Backpacking through this mysterious countryside is an amazing experience but what about taking your laptop and never missing a beat at the office as you ride through these limestone mountains and meandering rivers?

## Trip Planning
The Ha Giang Loop can be completed in as little as three days but almost everyone recommends five if you want to stop anywhere. For this reason I recomend taking a night buss to Ha Giang the city thursday and working in Ha Giang friday either in a one of the many cafes or your hostel if that suits you (I recomend you check out Chopai hostel it's on the map).

Weekday work aside you now have two days to fully enjoy what I consider the most epic part of the trip.

Come Monday you're new cowboy lifestyle starts. Generally my day would start at around six in the morning, I would work until around eleven then eat breakfast pack up and drive to the next town. Once I found a suitable stopping place I would find some lunch explore whatever village I am in then pick up  work arround sixish finishing up around nine and hitting the hay. I have never fealt more like a nomad then this, moving around constantly through this beutifull country working wheaver I wanted was an unforgettable experience.

## Creature Comforts
Internet wasent really a problem as I mentioned in [Working Abroad In Veitnam Everything You Need To Know](https://nomadpitstops.com/blog/working-abroad-in-veitnam-everything-you-need-to-know) pretty much anywhere I went I was able to find a pretty stable pretty fast wifi connection. No the problem was finding chairs and a clean work space. Cafes arent nearly as popular on the loop and when you do find them they tend to have child chairs and tables, bummer. This offten times restricted me to working either out of my home stay or squatting over my laptop which I can't imagine is great for posture.
