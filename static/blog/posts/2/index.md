For many travels the Ha Giang Loop is the final frontier. Bordering Vietnam and china if you choose to conquer this extreme motorbike loop you will be treated to some of the most majestic vistas in the whole of Vietnam.

Backpacking through this mysterious countryside is an amazing experience but what about taking your laptop and never missing a beat at the office as you ride through these limestone mountains and meandering rivers?

## A Day In The Life...
Working while taking on the challenge of the Ha Giang Loop was the most cowboy nomad lifestyle I have ever taken on. 

The day usually started at six in the morning where I would "scavenge" for the most stable WiFi connection I could find. Cafes, restaurants, and convenience stores were all on the menu for a healthy internet diet. 

After finding a suitable work area I would work until it became warm enough to start driving, usually around eleven. Depending on the day I would then drive for three to six hours until I reached the next town, stopping along the way to admire the jaw dropping landscape.

A stable WiFi connection was pretty much the only thing on my list for "must haves" when it came to hostels or home stays so if I could not find anything the driving would continue. 

Once the quest for a suitable rest area was complete I would generally go grab food and work for a few more hours and hit the hay.

This daily pattern was nice because it allowed me to work a solid eight hours every day but if you're less interested in the working aspect of living on the road you could definitely shorten those work hours up and take more stops along the way.

## The Comforts of The Road
While WiFi tended to not be a massive problem, chairs proved to be an annoying obstacle. Due to there price and small footprint, most cafes featured kids chairs and tables. Apart from making a six foot westerners look completely ridiculous, squatting over a laptop for many hours was not the most comfortable experience but I found it worth the aches.

## So, Should I Go?
The answer for this is going to very from person to person. If you are willing to put up with a little bit of an uncomfortable working situation for a once in a lifetime adventure, yes absolutely. Despite the destination's reputation I saw very few tourists while I was on the trail, which made for an incredibly raw and genuine experience. However if long days and a less then cozy working situation does not sound appealing you may want to look other places.
