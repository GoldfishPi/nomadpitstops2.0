Have you ever met those people who say "I'm not really in to things", this used to confuse me, now I am one of those people. A little over a year ago cleaned my closet of all but ten shirts, three sweatshirts, two pairs of jeans and an assortment of socks and underwear, this was the best decision of my life. I never knew how much stuff I had until I started getting rid of it all. Now I have an almost visceral reaction to bringing more stuff into my house that I don't need. This wasn't a switch though, a lot of people when they think minimalism they think somone who owns one fork and only meditates for three hours a day, that's just not true and I'd like to explain why.


## Minimalism is a principle not a lifestyle

Contrary to popular belief there isn't a allotted number of socks that you can own to call your self a minimalist, that would be rather intrusive and in my opinion minimalism should be intrusiveness to the point that you don't even notice it. So keep everything? Of course not! Here we come to what I like to think is the fundamental principle of minimalism. 


*Keep nothing in your life that is not necessary or brings you joy*


What I like about this principle is that it scales no matter where you are in your life you have more than what you need or brings you joy. As a minimalist it is your main focus to remove anything that does not fit this criteria. 

## How do I decide what to get rid of?

There are a lot of principles that get thrown around when it comes to this topic. Everyone has an opinion and no matter what someone will tell you you're wrong and not a real minimalist in reality there isn't a one size fits all answer. What is necessary for a rural home owner with a family wont be the same as a twenty year old renter in the city. It really is the principle that will guide you here, if you feel like something isn't bringing you joy take a hard look at it and decide why it is in your life. This is the same for relationships, if someone is a negative influence on your life, take a hard look at why you allow them into your mental space, keeping you mental space clutter free is arguably more important then your physical space. 


If you are curious on my processes for getting rid of things generally my rule of thumb is if I haven't used it in six months get rid of it.  


## Why does this matter?

When it comes to travel, it would be a disservice to not mention minimalism. Take it from me, everything becomes easier when you have less stuff. Minimalism trims a lot of the extra fat which would usually be slowing you down on your adventures, ask any veteran one bag traveler and they will tell you the joys of moving from place to place with nothing but a bag on there back. Overall Minimalism is something I think I will continue to pursue and I hope I inspired you maybe start as well.
