Have you ever met those people who say "I'm not really in to things", this used to confuse me, now I am one of those people. A little over a year ago cleaned my closet of all but ten shirts, three sweatshirts, two pairs of jeans and an assortment of socks and underwear, this was the best decision of my life.
