Three months before graduating high school I had a job offer from a silicon valley startup in an engineering position. Six months later I had my first business trip to California. Four months later I'm now nineteen years old with my dream job working remotely in Vietnam. I went from being the nerdy kid in class who tinkers with computers to being a world traveling software engineer and this is how it happened.

## Early On
When it comes to the parenting department I got the jackpot. My Mom is a retired school teacher who decided the school system was broken and home schooled me and my three other siblings until my jr. year of high school, this proved incredibly useful as it tought me how to work on my own without instructions. My Dad is a electrical engineer, he has been an incredible mentor for both programming and the professional world. Seriously Mom and Dad if you are reading this I can't thank you enough.

My first memories of programming come from my dad, while we were all sitting around eating at the dinner table eating my dad would talk about what he was programming at work, one of the most popular things was the "flashy flash program" as it would be known. This magical program had the ability to show lines of different colors and switch between them. A few days later my dad was working from home and I remember watching him program this magical flashing box, he writes in Lab View a graphical language that compiles down to C, it was mezmerizing watching him wire all these boxes together to add buttons and knobs to the user interface. 

Later when I was around nine years old for christmas my parents bought me and my older brother Lego Minestorms robotics sets. This was my first real taste of the powers of unlimited powers of programming, or at least the ability to drive a little plastic rover in circles forever. Being nine I needed my dads help for doing anything other then basic loops and if statements but it deffintatly tought me the fundementals of programming.

For the next three years magic was cool, programming exited my mind and all I wanted to be when I grew up was a magician. Maybe this would have been the case if one day after playing capture the flag I walked by a group of older kids who were talking about a tiny credit card sized computer that only cost $25. Later that night I went onto the computer and looked up somthing called a strawberry pie? Oh a raspberry pi. 

The day the pi was delivered I was so excited I stood up so fast I tipped over the chair I was sitting in as I ran out the door to meet the mail lady bearing my first computer. At first the pi was just a gimmick, somthing I could play around with and show off to my friends and family. Later I learned you could use the pins on the pi and somthing called python to turn on and off LEDs. So I tought myself python, I used Python For Kids which is still an amazing intro if you are a kid or an adult but I'm still impressed that I read a book to learn a language. Why didnt I just use youtube?

## Teen Life
Fast forward to fifteen, Minecraft was cool and Minecraft modding was cooler. I begged my mom to get me this online Minecraft modding course so I could teach myself modding and java. Twenty twenty heinsight this course was awful, it was basically just copy pasting code into eclipse but it was my first intro to java none the less.

Around the same time a friend from youth group invited me to join a robotics team he was starting. When you join a robotics team there should be a disclaimer to impossible challenges and long nights trying to debug your autonomous code, seriously I probably put more hours into programming while I was in robotics then at my current job. 

The next year of robotics the whole system moved to an android and java based platform, which ment I had to crack down on my java skills. That summer I fallowed a tutorial on how to make your own game engine in java. Seeing my new found skills with java my dad who was a mentor for the team volunteered me to teach the entire team java. While it pretty much crashed and burned the first year (most of the kids couldnt even manage to get hello world) this would become a yearly tradition for me teaching new members java.

## The Dark Ages
At sixteen I was an angsty awkward typical teenager. I never did bad in school but my older brother loved school and got A's in all his classes. Being a self cautious teen I felt like I also had to love school and get all A's. Never seeing programming as anything more then a card trick I started to feel like a total mess up and a looser. I developed a severe gamming addiction because I could win, which made me feel like a non looser.

pity party over.

## Realization
Senior year of high school! Pretty much on the straight and narrow.n I'd been excepted into schools seemed like clear sailing. Then I realized it wasn't. The conclusion I came to was that if I went to college right now whith my current mental state I would either drop out or flunk out.
