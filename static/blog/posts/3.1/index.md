It is no secret that cafes are a digital nomads best friend, there really is somthing about the constently shifting surounding and consitent cafine intake which makes for an incredibly well focused and creative work space. It is also no secret that Hanoi has some of the best coffee and cafes in the world so let's check out a couple of my personal favorites.
## Mom and Pops
### Giang Cafe
Many say Giang Cafe has the best egg coffee in Hanoi, and I can verify it is delecious. While this title tends to attract quite a few tourists (it's location in the old quarter doesnt help either.) I think the coffee and the atmosphere makes up for it.
## Chains
Sometimes you want a little consitency, you want to know what you can order when you step into a cafe. While these are by no means western chains, you will be able to find each of these in most parts of Hanoi.
### Cafe Cito
While I was staying in the Dinh Binh district Cafe Cito became my pet favorite afternoon cafe. There was somthing about there intense dark coffee with 
### Cafe Cong
Sporting military garb good working tables and an absolutly iced coconut coffee this cafe quickly became a staple place to work or read while I was staying in Hanoi. While there is one situated in the Old Quarter, it is rather small. My favorite is by far the multi level location in the dinh binh district.
### Aha Cafe
The most ubiquidous cafe in Hanoi it would be a challenge to walk down the street and not walk past one. Regardless of there regularity there Milk coffee is nothing to complain about and the locations are almost always multi leveled which is nice for finding just the right amount of ambient noise. The downside to Aha Cafes is they tend to have stools rather then chairs so you are going to be squating for a couple hours.
